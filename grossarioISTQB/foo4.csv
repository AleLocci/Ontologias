"Term Name","Definition"
"defect prediction","A technique to predict the areas within the test object in which defects 
will occur or the quantity of defects that are present"
"deterministic system","A system which will produce the same set of outputs and final state 
from a given set of inputs and starting state"
"edge computing","The part of a distributed architecture in which information processing is 
performed close to where that information is used."
"epoch","An iteration of ML training on the whole training dataset"
"evolution","The process of continuous change from a lower, simpler, or worse 
state to a higher, more complex, or better state"
"expert system","An AI-based system for solving problems in a particular domain or 
application area by drawing inferences from a knowledge base 
developed from human expertise"
"explainability","The level of understanding how the AI-based system came up with a 
given result (ISO/IEC TR 29119-11)"
"explainable AI (XAI)","The field of study related to understanding the factors that influence AI 
system outputs"
"exploratory data analysis 
(EDA)","The interactive, hypothesis-driven and visual exploration of data used 
to support feature engineering"
"F1-Score","An ML functional performance metric used to evaluate a classifier 
which provides a balance between recall and precision"
"false negative (FN)","An ML model prediction in which the model mistakenly predicts the 
negative class"
"false positive (FP)","An ML model prediction in which the model mistakenly predicts the 
positive class"
"feature","An individual measurable attribute of the input data used for training by 
an ML algorithm and for prediction by an ML model"
"feature engineering","The activity in which those attributes in the raw data that best 
represent the underlying relationships that should appear in the ML 
model are identified for use in the training data (ISO/IEC TR 29119-11)"
"flexibility","The ability of a system to work in contexts outside its initial 
specification (After ISO/IEC TR 29119-11)"
