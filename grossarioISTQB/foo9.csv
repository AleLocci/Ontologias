"Term Name","Definition"
"safety","The expectation that a system does not, under defined conditions, lead 
to a state in which human life, health, property, or the environment is 
endangered (ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207)"
"sample bias","A type of bias where the dataset is not fully representative of the data 
space to which ML is applied"
"search algorithm","An algorithm that systematically visits a subset of all possible states or 
structures until the goal state or structure is reached (After ISO/IEC TR

given set of test inputs and state"
