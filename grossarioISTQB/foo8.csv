"Term Name","Definition"
"procedural reasoning","AI technology used for constructing real-time reasoning systems that 
can perform complex tasks in dynamic environments"
"random forest","Ensemble ML technology for classification, regression and other tasks 
that operate by constructing and running many decision trees and then 
either outputting the mode of the class or the mean prediction of the 
individual trees"
"reasoning technique","AI that generates conclusions from available information using logical 
techniques (After ISO/IEC TR 29119-11)"
"recall","An ML functional performance metric used to evaluate a classifier, 
which measures the proportion of actual positives that were predicted 
correctly (After ISO/IEC TR 29119-11) 
Synonym: sensitivity"
"receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curve","A graphical plot that illustrates the ability of a binary classifier as its 
discrimination threshold is varied"
"regression","A type of ML function that results in a numerical or continuous output 
value for a given input (After ISO/IEC TR 29119-11)"
"regression model","An ML model whose expected output for a given numeric input is a 
continuous variable (After ISO/IEC DIS 23053)"
"reinforcement learning","The activity of building an ML model using a process of trial and 
reward to achieve an objective (After ISO/IEC TR 29119-11)"
"reward function","A function that defines the success of reinforcement learning"
"reward hacking","The activity performed by an intelligent agent to maximize its reward 
function to the detriment of meeting the original objective (After 
ISO/IEC TR 29119-11)"
"R-squared","A statistical measure of how close the data points are to the fitted 
regression line.  
Synonym:  coefficient of determination"
"rule engine","A set of rules that determine which actions should occur when certain 
conditions are satisfied"
