"Term Name","Definition"
"","Synonym: weak AI"
"natural language 
processing (NLP)","A field of computing that provides the ability to read, understand, and 
derive meaning from natural languages"
"neural network","A network of primitive processing elements connected by weighted 
links with adjustable weights, in which each element produces a value 
by applying a nonlinear function to its input values, and transmits it to 
other elements or presents it as an output value (ISO/IEC 2382) 
Synonym: artificial neural network"
"neural network trojan","A vulnerability injected into a neural network using a data poisoning 
attack with the intent of exploiting it later"
"neuromorphic processor","An integrated circuit designed to mimic the biological neurons of the 
human brain"
"neuron","A node in a neural network, usually receiving multiple input values and 
generating an activation value"
"noise","A distortion or corruption in data"
"non-deterministic system","A system which will not always produce the same set of outputs and 
final state given a particular set of inputs and starting state"
"outlier","An observation that lies outside the overall pattern of the data 
distribution"
"overfitting","The generation of an ML model that corresponds too closely to the 
training dataset, resulting in a model that finds it difficult to generalize 
to new data (After ISO/IEC TR 29119-11)"
"perceptron","A neural network with just one layer and one neuron"
"precision","An ML functional performance metric used to evaluate a classifier, 
which measures the proportion of predicted positives that were correct 
(After ISO/IEC TR 29119-11)"
"pre-trained model","An ML model already trained when it was obtained"
"probabilistic system","A system whose behavior is described in terms of probabilities; hence 
its outputs cannot be perfectly predicted"
